# Advancing-Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
The primary goal of this work is to create a precise model that aids in the detection of pneumonia and the category which it belongs to i.e., Viral Pneumonia, bacterial Pneumonia. As part of the diagnosis, determine pneumonia using chest X-ray pictures. In the proposed work, deep learning Models like Inception V3 and MobileNetV2 are used to leverage their deep architectures and
powerful feature learning capabilities to efficiently On the basis of evaluation criteria like accuracy, precision, and recall on the dataset of chest X-ray images, the suggested model's efficacy is then assessed.
